## ABSTRACT

The decentralized identifier (DID) is a new type of globally unique identifier that offers a model for lifetime scope, portable digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority and can never be taken away. DIDs are the “atomic units” of a new layer of decentralized identity infrastructure. However, it may be possible to extend DIDs from its primary use as an identifier of people to identify everything. We can use DIDs to help us identify and manage objects, machines or agents through their digital twins, to locations, to events, and even to autonomic data. The paper will present novel use-cases for DIDs that relate to the field of every author.

DIDs are only the base layer of decentralized identity infrastructure. The next higher layer -- where most of the value is unlocked -- is verifiable claims. This is the technical term for a digitally signed electronic credential that conforms to the interoperability standards being developed by the W3C Verifiable Claims Working Group. When a DID is extended to machines and autonomic data, those DIDs can also hold verifiable claims and attestations.
