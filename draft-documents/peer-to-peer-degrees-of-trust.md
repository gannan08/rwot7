# Peer to Peer Degrees of Trust

Authors: Harrison Stahl, Titus Capilnean, Peter Snyder, Tyler Yasaka

The concept of an open and permissionless system is philosophically appealing. However, there are certain applications that require the concept of trusted identities. At a minimum, all systems that involve voting rely on unique, trustworthy identities to cast a vote. This includes any consensus mechanism as well as any rating system. Such systems face a dilemma: how can we filter out bad actors without a centralized authority?

In this paper we propose a framework for reasoning about reputation using a web of trust. We briefly summarize the history of peer-to-peer reputation, define 3 layers required for peer-to-peer reputation, and explore possible applications of this framework.
