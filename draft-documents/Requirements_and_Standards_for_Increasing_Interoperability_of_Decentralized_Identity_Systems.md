Requirements and Standards for Increasing Interoperability of Decentralized Identity Systems
============================================================================================

Abstract
--------

* Identify core high-level requirements for interoperable decentralized identity systems (including data modelling, cryptographic requirements, and data representations)
* Talk about importance of standards and conventions in facilitating interop, increasing adoption, and accelerating innovation
* Come up with top categories of standards for interoperability - conventions for use of DIDDoc elements, key types and purposes, data format, and others
* Identify current applicable standards and specifications
* Identify gaps in current standards and specifications and propose ways to fill them
* Identify the four or five most used cryptographic key types and finalize their descriptions
