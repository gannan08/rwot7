*And mom, and your daughter, and Aunt Susie, and that guy who works at
 Subway, and yourself*

One of the major problems with bootstrapping self-sovereign identity
is that it requires adoption by a large number of people. Pushing
self-sovereign identity from the top down is most likely to result in
a technology thatâ€™s not actually used, while instead encouraging the
average person to demand self-sovereign identity from the bottom up
will result in the organic development of a vibrant, well-utilized
ecosystem.

This paper addresses that need by offering arguments to a variety of
people who might be reluctant to use self-sovereign identity,
uninterested in its possibilities, or oblivious to the dangers of
centralization.
