# Use Cases and Proposed Solutions for Verifiable Offline Credentials

**Authors:** Michael Lodder, Sam Chase, Wolf McNally

### Abstract

Self Sovereign Identity is now a widely discussed topic especially in the context of verifiable credentialsâ€“attributes attested by third-parties about an individual or entity that can be used as proof about them such as a digital drivers license or passport. This has enabled new systems to be developed to address security and privacy issues. 

In this paper we cover various scenarios where some or all parties do not have network access, but require cryptographic verification (message protection and/or proofs). Furthermore, communications between the parties may be only via legacy voice channels. Applicable situations include marine, subterranian, remote expeditions, disaster areas, refugee camps, and high-security installations. Another use-case is pedagogical, where low-bandwidth communications are used to teach principles of cryptographically secure communication.
